It maintains relationships between entities to enable efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data in a realistic university setting.

## ðŸ”¹ ER Schema ðŸ”¹

The ER Schema comprises the following entities and relationships:

- **Department**:
  - Primary Key: `dept_name`
  - Head (Faculty) : `head_faculty_id`

- **Faculty**:
  - Primary Key: `emp_id`
  - Each faculty can:
    - Head a department
    - Teach multiple courses
    - Coordinate a course

- **Course**:
  - Primary Key: `course_code`
  - Foreign Keys:
    - `dept_name` â†’ Department
    - `coordinator_id` â†’ Faculty
  - Each course belongs to a department.

- **FacultyCourse** (Teaching Assignments):
  - Composite Primary Key: `(emp_id, course_code)`
  - Foreign Keys:
    - `emp_id` â†’ Faculty
    - `course_code` â†’ Course

- **Student**:
  - Primary Key: `roll_number`
  - Foreign Key:
    - `dept_name` â†’ Department
  
- **StudentCourse** (Enrollments and Attendance):
  - Composite Primary Key: `(roll_number, course_code)`
  - Foreign Keys:
    - `roll_number` â†’ Student
    - `course_code` â†’ Course
  - Stores attendance percentage for each student in each course.

- **Exam**:
  - Primary Key: `exam_id`
  - Foreign Keys:
    - `course_code` â†’ Course
    - `created_by` â†’ Faculty
  - Each exam belongs to a course and is created by a faculty.

- **ExamAttempt**:
  - Primary Key: `attempt_id`
